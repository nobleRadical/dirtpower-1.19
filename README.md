# DirtPower  
Like redpower, but... (bad) (updated to 1.19)

Right now, there is one feature: Encased Redstone Powder, crafted like this:

![Crafting Recipe]  

This block acts as redstone wire, but being a block can work underwater and vertically.
The block can also be dyed green and blue. Different colored blocks will not transmit power between each other.

![Multicolor]  

I might add more features later, but for now this is a simple mod that does one specific thing.  
I welcome all feedback, so let me know if I can improve this.
